# Glide Marketing Drift Review

## Load

- `Glide HQ/Harness Design Principles.md`
- `Glide HQ/Checklists/Marketing Drift Review.md`
- Operational files listed in the checklist
- Installed `glide-*` skills

## Process

1. Treat `Harness Design Principles.md` as read-only unless the user explicitly asks to edit it.
2. Review operating files for drift.
3. Fix only clear non-behavioral issues directly.
4. Reduce verbosity when clarity and behavior survive.
5. Ask before behavior-changing edits.
6. Preserve human-approval boundaries for external actions.

## Output

- Drift found or not found.
- Files changed.
- Verbosity reductions.
- Approval-needed recommendations.
