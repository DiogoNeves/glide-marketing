## Process

1. Start with a short internal analysis and plan: what to inspect, what matters most, and which tracks can run in parallel.
2. Use parallel subagents when available. Give each subagent a narrow track: source/content gaps, open-loop research, market/customer/channel research, content reuse opportunities, eval/process improvement, stale working-memory candidates, or concise-instruction cleanup.
3. Integrate findings yourself. Do not paste subagent outputs wholesale.
4. Use `$glide-deep-research-subject` for source-heavy loops, `$glide-create-marketing-skill` when a repeatable marketing process should become a utility, and `$glide-marketing-drift-review` for process drift when useful.
5. Prefer broad reusable patterns over adding highly specific rules.
6. Update Glide HQ quietly when there is durable value.
7. Retire stale working-memory candidates only when unused for over a month and plainly low-value, duplicated, or superseded. Preserve useful context in long-term memory before removing it from active working files.
8. Keep a rolling 4-day audit of this schedule's changes in `Glide HQ/Evals/Nightly Research Audit.md`.
9. Ask for approval before behavior-changing instruction edits, destructive deletion, sensitive external actions, posting or sending marketing material, or changes requiring user judgment.

## Output

- No user-facing report by default.
- Internal audit of changed files and why.
- Updated research, open loops, questions, source links, content notes, eval notes, or concise operating instructions when useful.
- Approval-needed items only when required.
